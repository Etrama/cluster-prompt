Question: On a particular day, a car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it traveled from Ngapara to Zipra. If the car took 60 hours to travel from Ngapara to Zipra, calculate the total time the car traveled that day.
Let's think step by step
If the car traveled from Ningi to Zipra in 80% of the time it traveled from Ngapara to Zipra, it took 80/100*60 = 48 hours to travel from Ningi to Zipra.
The total travel time that day is 48+60 = 108 hours
The answer is 108

Question: A rectangle has a length of 3 inches and a width of 6 inches. A square has a width of 5 inches. What is the difference in area between the two shapes?
Let's think step by step
The area of the rectangle is 3 x 6 = 18 sq in
The area of the square is 5 x 5 = 25 sq in
The difference is 25 - 18 = 7 sq in
The answer is 7

Question: Martine has 6 more than twice as many peaches as Benjy. Benjy has one-third as many peaches as Gabrielle. If Martine has 16 peaches, how many does Gabrielle have?
Let's think step by step
Benjy has b peaches.
Martine has 6+2b=16 peaches
2b=10
b=5
Then Gabrielle has 5*3=15.
The answer is 15

Question: Dulce's father has eight orange trees on his farm. If each tree has 200 fruits and Dulce picks 2/5 of the oranges from each tree, calculate the total number of fruits remaining in all the trees.
Let's think step by step
The total number of oranges in all the trees before Dulce picked any is 8 trees * 200 oranges/tree = 1600 oranges.
If each orange tree has 200 oranges, and Dulce picks 2/5 of each tree's oranges, she picks 2/5 * 200 oranges = 80 oranges.
Since the total number of orange trees is eight, Dulce picked 8 trees * 80 oranges/tree = 640 oranges from all the trees.
After picking 640 oranges from the trees, the total number of oranges remaining became 1600 oranges - 640 oranges = 960 oranges.
The answer is 960

Question: Carla is taking attendance for her sixth-grade class. She knows that 2 students are in the restroom, and one less than three times that number of students are absent. If there are four rows with six desks each that are all 2/3 full, how many students does Carla teach, including the ones in and out of the classroom?
Let's think step by step
First find the number of absent students: 2 students * 3 - 1= 5 students
Now find the number of students in each row of desks: 6 desks/row * 2 students / 3 desks = 4 students/row
Now find the number of students in all the rows: 4 rows * 4 students/row = 16 students
Now add the students that are absent or in the bathroom: 16 students + 2 students + 5 students = 23 students
The answer is 23

Question: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Let's think step by step
Let c be the number of cucumbers and t the number of tomatoes.
The total is the sum of the number of cucumbers and that of tomatoes, which is c + t = 280 piece of vegetables
Since there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, this means c =t/3
Therefore 3*c = t.
The sum will therefore be c + 3*c = 280 pieces of vegetables
This means that 4*c = 280 vegetables
Therefore c = 280/4 = 70 cucumbers.
The answer is 70

Question: Roberto and Valerie are jumping rope at recess. Roberto can skip 4,200 times an hour. Valerie can skip 80 times a minute. If they jump rope for fifteen minutes straight, how many skips will they total?
Let's think step by step
Roberto skips 70 times per minute because 4,200 / 60 = 70.
Together they skip 150 times a minute.
They will skip 2,250 times because 150 x 15 = 2,250
The answer is 2,250

Question: Sam shared a sum of money between his three cousins Sandra, Amy and Ruth in the ratio 2:1:3 respectively. If Amy got $50, how much did Sandra get?
Let's think step by step
Going by the ratio, for every 1 part that Amy gets, Sandra will get 2 parts
Since Amy got $50, Sandra will get 2*$50 = $100
The answer is 100

Question: Bingley has 5 bracelets. Kelly gives Bingley a fourth of her 16 bracelets. Then Bingley gives a third of his bracelets to his little sister. How many bracelets does Bingley have remaining?
Let's think step by step
Kelly gives Bingley 16 / 4 = 4 bracelets
Bingley has 5 + 4 = 9 bracelets
Bingley gives his little sister 9 / 3 = 3 bracelets
In the end, Bingley has 9 - 3 = 6 bracelets remaining
The answer is 6

Question: Sam bought a heavy safe with a combination lock. There were four rows with twenty gold bars per row arranged in the safe. If each gold bar is worth $20000, calculate the total worth of the gold bars in the safe.
Let's think step by step
If there were four rows of twenty gold bars arranged in the safe, the total number of bars in the safe is 4*20 = 80 bars.
Since each gold bar is worth $20000, the 80 bars are worth 80*$20000 = $1,600,000
The answer is 1600000
