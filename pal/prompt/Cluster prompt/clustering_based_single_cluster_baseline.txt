Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?
Let's think step by step
The mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $359.60
This makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + 800 + 260 = $1419.60
Similarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $243.60
Thus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.60 + 900 + 200 = 1343.60
Therefore, the difference in total monthly costs is 1419.60 - 1343.60 = $76
The answer is 76

Question: On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw. When the draw was done, she was declared the winner of the 5th prize of $90. Excited, she quickly dashed to play slots at one of the casinos in Atlantic City. Unfortunately, she lost $50 at the first slot machine, $10 at the second and $5 at the last one.  Dejected, she decided to take a long walk. She soon grew thirsty and entered the first gas station she saw. She picked a $1 bottle of water and while paying for it, she bought a $1 lottery ticket. To her utter delight, she won an instant prize of $65. How much money did Renata end up having?
Let's think step by step
After the charity ticket purchase on Saturday morning, Renata remained with 10 - 4 = 6 dollars.
Adding the prize money give her 6+90 = 96 dollars
At the casino, she lost 50 + 10 + 5 = 65 dollars
Thus far, Renata remained with 96 - 65 = 31 dollars
The amount she spent on the bottle of water and lottery ticket is 1 + 1 = 2 dollars
This means that she remained with 31- 2 = 29 dollars
Since she won 65 dollars, Renata’s ended up having 29 + 65 = 94 dollars.
The answer is 94

Question: As a freelancer, Baylor is paid for every finished work of a client he does on a freelance marketplace. Currently, he has $4000 on his dashboard from previous work done. He is currently working for three clients, with the first client paying him half the amount of money he currently has on his dashboard once the job is done. The second client will pay him 2/5 times more money than the first client once Baylor finishes his work. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together once he finishes the job. How much money will Baylor have in his dashboard after all the clients pay him for his work?
Let's think step by step
The first client will pay Baylor 1/2*$4000=$2000.
The second client will pay Baylor 2/5 times more money than the first client, a total of 2/5*$2000 = $800
The total amount of money the second client will pay Baylor once the job is done is $2000+$800 = $2800
The total amount of money the first and the second client will pay Baylor after their work is finished is $2800+$2000 = $4800
The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together, a total of 2*$4800 = $9600
Together, the three clients will pay Baylor $9600+$4800 = $14400 once he finishes their jobs.
In his dashboard, Baylor will have $14400+$4000 = $18400
The answer is 18400

Question: Monica and Sheila are twins. Their mother gave them $50 and told them to buy some toilet paper and spend the remainder on groceries. The toilet paper cost $12. They bought apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham for twice the cost of the toilet paper. Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly. They saw some boots they really liked, but a pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left. How much more would Monica and Sheila each have to add of their own money to buy two pairs of boots?
Let's think step by step
The groceries cost $12 x 2 = $24
Including the toilet paper, Monica and Sheila had already spent $12 + $24 = $36
This means that they had $50 - $36 = $14 left to spend on themselves.
However, the boots cost $14 x 3 = $42 per pair.
Two pairs of boots would cost $42 x 2 = $84
They need another $84 - $14 = $70 to buy two pairs.
Each of them needs to add another $70/2 = $35
The answer is 35

Question: An elementary school teacher is making Halloween goodie bags for her class.  She wants the bags to be personalized, so she surveys her students asking whether they'd like a vampire-themed bag or a pumpkin-themed bag.  Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?
Let's think step by step
Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $7.
Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $10.
Therefore, the teacher must spend 7 + 10 = $17.
The answer is 17

Question: A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land.  In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass.  After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag.  Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month.  Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months.   If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?
Let's think step by step
First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.
Solving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.
This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months.
Next, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.
The rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.
Therefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.
So, the rancher will need to spend 36*10 = $360 per year on feed corn.
The answer is 360

Question: A professional company is hiring for a new position. They have two qualified applicants. The first applicant will accept a salary of $42000 and make the company $93000 in the first year, but needs 3 months of additional training that costs $1200 a month. The second applicant does not need training and will make the company $92000 in the first year, but is requesting a salary of $45000 and a hiring bonus of 1% of his salary. Less the amount it will cost to pay for each candidate, how many more dollars will one candidate make the company than the other in the first year?
Let's think step by step
The first candidate’s training will cost 1200 * 3 = $3600.
That candidate will make the company 93000 - 42000 - 3600 = $47400 in the first year.
The second candidate’s bonus will cost 45000 * 1 / 100 = $450.
That candidate will make the company 92000 - 45000 - 450 = $46550 in the first year.
Thus, the first candidate will make the company 47400 - 46550 = $850 more in the first year.
The answer is 850

Question: When the strawberries at Fruity Farm are ready for harvest, Miguel charges each interested picker $4 to access the strawberry fields. Once there, people pick as many strawberries as they wish, and then take them to Miguel for weighing and pricing. This year, the standard price of a pound of strawberries is $20. Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?
Let's think step by step
To gain entry into the strawberry fields, Sally, Jenny and Moses paid a total of 4 * 3 = 12 dollars
This means that before Miguel applied the $12 discount, the cost was 128 + 12 = 140 dollars
We get the weight by dividing the cost by the price of strawberries per pound, 140/20 = 7 pounds
The answer is 7

Question: A plumber is trying to decide which of three different jobs he should take to make the most money.  The first job involves fixing three toilets and three sinks at an apartment complex.  The second involves two toilets and five sinks at a different apartment complex.  The third involves fixing one toilet, two showers and three sinks at a third apartment complex.  If the plumber charges $30 to fix a sink, $40 to fix a shower and $50 to fix a toilet, what is the most money the plumber can earn if he can only choose one of these three jobs?
Let's think step by step
If the plumber chooses the first job, he would earn 3*50 + 3*30 = $240.
If he chooses the second, he'd earn 2*50 + 5*30 = $250.
If he chooses the third, he'd earn 50 + 2*40 + 3*30 = $220.
Therefore, the most money he can earn from one of these jobs is $250.
The answer is 250

Question: At the burger hut, you can buy a burger for $5, french fries for $3, and a soft drink for $3.  If you order a special burger meal, you get all 3 of these food items for $9.50. A kid’s burger is $3, a kid’s french fries are $2, and a kid's juice box is $2.  They also have a kids meal of all 3 kids' food items for $5. Mr. Parker buys 2 burger meals for his wife and himself.  He also buys 2 burger meals and 2 kid's meals for his 4 children.  How much money does Mr. Parker save by buying the 6 meals versus buying the individual food items?
Let's think step by step
To buy regular food items individually, they cost $5 + $3 + $3 = $11.
To buy kids food items individually, they cost $3 + $2 + $2 = $7.
If you buy the special burger meal, you save $11 - $9.50 = $1.50.
If you buy the kid's meal, you save $7 - $5 = $2.
Mr. Parker buys 4 special burger meals, bringing his discount to 4 x $1.50 = $6.
He buys 2 kid's meals, bringing his discount to 2 x $2 = $4.
The total savings for Mr. Parker is $6 + $4 = $10.
The answer is 10
