When we used GPT before, our model naturally returned code.
We assume in this case that the ChatGPT API will return code as well.
We now parse this code, as before as done in PAL.

We comment out the timeout stuff in windows as it is signal.SIGALARM will only work on Unix.

The ProgramInterface class has the following methods:
    - init
    - clear_history
    - process_generation_to_code
    - generate
    - execute
    - run

The new ProgramChatInterface class has the following methods:
    - init
    - process_generation_to_code
    - generate
    - run

We are missing the following function in ProgramChatInterface:
    - clear_history (MISSING)
    - execute (MISSING)

Let's follow the workflow of the ProgramChatInterface Class:
    - It inherits from the ProgramInterface class.
    - SO, it should have access to clear_history and execute.

The above is taken care of.

We are now concerned with the exeuction of ProgramInterface and ProgramChatInterface.
Edited files: interface.py, backend.py

The run function will give us the actual answer at the end.
