      "Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "The mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $359.60\n",
      "This makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + 800 + 260 = $1419.60\n",
      "Similarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $243.60\n",
      "Thus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.60 + 900 + 200 = 1343.60\n",

      "Question: On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw. When the draw was done, she was declared the winner of the 5th prize of $90. Excited, she quickly dashed to play slots at one of the casinos in Atlantic City. Unfortunately, she lost $50 at the first slot machine, $10 at the second and $5 at the last one.  Dejected, she decided to take a long walk. She soon grew thirsty and entered the first gas station she saw. She picked a $1 bottle of water and while paying for it, she bought a $1 lottery ticket. To her utter delight, she won an instant prize of $65. How much money did Renata end up having?\n",

      "Question: Monica and Sheila are twins. Their mother gave them $50 and told them to buy some toilet paper and spend the remainder on groceries. The toilet paper cost $12. They bought apples, butter, eggs, and a large ham for twice the cost of the toilet paper. Since they still had some leftover money, they called their mother and she gave them permission to buy whatever they wanted for themselves as long as they shared the money evenly. They saw some boots they really liked, but a pair of boots costs 3 times the amount they had left. How much more would Monica and Sheila each have to add of their own money to buy two pairs of boots?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "The groceries cost $12 x 2 = $24\n",

Of her 25 students, 11 indicate they want the vampire-themed bag and 14 indicate they want the pumpkin-themed bag.  The store the teacher shops at sells packs of 5 of each theme at a price of $3 per package, as well as individual bags of each theme at a price of $1 each.  What is the least amount of money the teacher can spend on the bags if she buys every student the theme they requested?\n",

      "Because it is cheaper to buy the packs of 5, the teacher should satisfy the 11 students who want the vampire theme with 2 packs of 5 and 1 individual bag. This will cost the teacher 2*3 + 1*1 = $7.\n",
      "Similarly, the 14 students who want a pumpkin-themed bag can be satisfied by 2 packs of 5 and 4 individual bags at a cost of 2*3 + 4*1 = $10.\n",

      "Question: A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land.  In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass.  After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag.  Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month.  Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months.   If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "First, the 144 acres of grass will be eaten according to the equation 5*2*T + 8*1*T = 144.\n",
      "Solving this equation for T, we find 18*T = 144, or T = 8 months of food are covered by the animals grazing on the rancher's pasture.\n",
      "This means the farmer must buy feed corn for the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 months.\n",
      "Next, the rancher's 8 sheep will require 4/2 = 2 bags of feed corn each, or 8*2 = 16 bags of feed corn in total for the 4 month period.\n",
      "The rancher's 5 cows will require 4/1 = 4 bags of feed corn each, or 5*4 = 20 bags of feed corn in total for the month.\n",
      "Therefore, the rancher needs 16+20 = 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.\n",

The second applicant does not need training and will make the company $92000 in the first year, but is requesting a salary of $45000 and a hiring bonus of 1% of his salary. Less the amount it will cost to pay for each candidate, how many more dollars will one candidate make the company than the other in the first year?\n",

Miguel is a very generous man. He deducts the entrance charge from the cost of the harvest. Sally, Jenny and Moses have just finished their strawberry picking and are headed home. They paid $128 for their harvest. How many pounds of strawberry did they pick?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",

      "Question: Hasan is packing up his apartment because he’s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers’ scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers’ scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Let x be the number of plates removed from the box.\n",
      "Hasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold 20 * 16, or 320 ounces.\n",
      "Each plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is (38 - x) * 10 ounces\n",
      "Since these two values are equal, we can write the equation (38 - x) * 10 = 320.\n",
      "Dividing both sides by 10 leaves 38-x = 32.\n",
      "Adding x to both sides gives 38 – x + x = 32 +x, or, 38 = 32 +x\n",
      "Subtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of x, which is the number of plates removed from the box, 38 -32 = 32 + x – 32, or, 6 = x\n",

The curry house needs 3 peppers for very spicy curries, 2 peppers for spicy curries, and only 1 pepper for mild curries. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for 30 very spicy curries, 30 spicy curries, and 10 mild curries. They now buy enough peppers for 15 spicy curries and 90 mild curries. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "The curry house previously bought 3 peppers per very spicy curry * 30 very spicy curries = 90 peppers for very spicy curries.\n",
      "They also bought 2 peppers per spicy curry * 30 spicy curries = 60 peppers for spicy curries.\n",
      "They also bought 1 pepper per mild curry * 10 mild curries = 10 peppers for mild curries.\n",

If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?\\nLet's think step by step\\nThe mileage cost for the first apartment will be 31*20*0.58 = $359.60\\nThis makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + 800 + 260 = $1419.60\\nSimilarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be 21*20*0.58 = $243.60\\nThus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.60 + 900 + 200 = 1343.60\\nTherefore, the difference in total monthly costs is 1419.60 - 1343.60 = $76\\nThe answer is 76\\n\\nQuestion: On Saturday morning, Renata had $10 to spend. She first went and made a $4 donation in exchange for a ticket to the local charity draw. When the draw was done, she was declared the winner of the 5th prize of $90. Excited, she quickly dashed to play slots at one of the casinos in Atlantic City. Unfortunately, she lost $50 at the first slot machine, $10 at the second and $5 at the last one.  Dejected, she decided to take a long walk. She soon grew thirsty and entered the first gas station she saw. She picked a $1 bottle of water and while paying for it, she bought a $1 lottery ticket. To her utter delight, she won an instant prize of $65. How much money did Renata end up having?\\nLet's think step by step\\nAfter the charity ticket purchase on Saturday morning, Renata remained with 10 - 4 = 6 dollars.\\nAdding the prize money give her 6+90 = 96 dollars\\nAt the casino, she lost 50 + 10 + 5 = 65 dollars\\nThus far, Renata remained with 96 - 65 = 31 dollars\\nThe amount she spent on the bottle of water and lottery ticket is 1 + 1 = 2 dollars\\nThis means that she remained with 31- 2 = 29 dollars\\nSince she won 65 dollars, Renata’s ended up having 29 + 65 = 94 dollars.\\nThe answer is 94\\n\\nQuestion: {question}\\nLet's think step by step\""
